#install munin to get some statistics

You need a webserver, so that you can see the statistics. Read [installApache2]

== install ==

{{{
apt-get install munin
}}}

Normally it works out of the box. You want to add the bind_ plugin, which you can find in the subversion repository under munin/plugins/bind_ (just copy it "as is" in the directory /etc/munin/plugins/ and restart the munin node daemon with /etc/init.d/munin-node restart).
