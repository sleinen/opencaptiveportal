Tunnels to the according (commercial) WLan Internet Service Provider (WISP).

The OpenCaptivePortal Software should run on a GNU/Linux Box, which is
interconnected to a Docking Network at a University in Switzerland. See the
picture OpenCaptivePortal.png. The Box with the OpenCaptivePortal (OCP)
should achieve the ollowing objectives:

 * Acces from the Docking Network (e.g. public WLan) the selected resources
   # VPN Router of the local University
   # All other VPN Router of Swiss Universities as definied in the SWITCHconnect Classic ACL (Accesslist), which you can find under: http://www.switch.ch/mobile/classic/
   # Commercial ISPs (WISP): If a user wants to establish a connections via a WISP, he must visit the landing page of the OCP and choose a WISP. Each WISP has a iFrame on this landing page  If the user clicks on an iFrame the OCP should route all following traffic from this user through a GRE Tunnel to the specific WISP.
   # Smart agents (like iPass) offers users the possibility to automatically connect to an WLan (for details on smart agents see [smartAgents]).
   # Event Login, e.g. a simple login formular on the landing page where guest on events can login in (without vpn oder WISP login), see TODO.
 * IPv4 (IPv6 planned)
