= TODO =

Here we want to write down, which task need to be done. 
If you are interrested, you can get in contact with us and solve some of the tasks.

Administrative:
  * Configure archive and link on website
  * Describe TODO task, so that other person can do this tasks
  * What about this /get dhcp log http request (like the xml rpc ?)


Security check:
  * Until now no view on security!
  * Check all pages with login forms
  * Check all pages where you have to be logedin


Hole project:
  * A install routine would be over kill (?)
  * Complete documentation of a new installation


Landing page:
  * Get the listen ip address for xml-rpc from fqdn from ssl cert
  * (traffic) statistics (-> ntop ?)
  * Enable https (done ?)

To test:
  * route.php 
  * back.php


Nice to have:
  * IPv6 cabability: The WISPs are maybe not able to offer IPv6 connectivity. In this case we can use teredo. 
  * Possible TODOs: 
    * Django has no IPv6 data type/field -> we have to expand the models.
    * Document, what is necessary for Teredo. And implement it.

  * Get mailing list ocp-dev (et) switch.ch
